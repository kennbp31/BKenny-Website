# BKenny-Website

Website designed using Flask and Jinga. Originally created just using HTML, JS, and CSS. 
Converted to Flask to make it easier to change and to eventually modify email functionality to python code and add a SQL back end for 
image maintenence. 

Procfile and requirements are necessary for Heroku to serve the app.

Being used as a tool to practice responsive formating, and to provide potential employers with a quick overview of myself.
