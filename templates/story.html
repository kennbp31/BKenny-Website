                <h1>About Me</h1>

                <p class="blackBackground rounded">
                 &emsp; <big>Hello</big>, and thank you for taking the time to review my portfolio! Below is a <i>'quick'</i> overview of my professional journey up until now!

                 <br><br>&emsp; Originally from <b>Syracuse, NY,</b> I worked for a software company providing financial and management software solutions to self-storage companies
                 across the country. In that role I acted as a Software Support Analyst and Large Account Manager gaining a firm understanding of software development workflows, team dynamics, and how to translate clientâ€™s business needs
                 into deliverable software. A few of my daily responsibilities included troubleshooting client issues, providing data repairs using SQL,
                 coding custom installers for large accounts specific business rules, training users of the software, and migrating clients from existing software to our own.

                 <br><br>&emsp; I moved to the <b>Research Triangle</b> Area of North Carolina in 2015 to work at Farragut Systems, a leading producer of local government software solutions.
                 Although the title was the same, my expertise and abilities grew exponentially with the new challenges.
                 In addition to my existing responsibilities at Syrasoft, I was now coding long and complex stored procedures, performing routine maintenance and troubleshooting on large SQL Server Databases,
                 troubleshooting issues for clients using our cloud-based SaaS, leading large conferences, managing documentation and writing complex guides for lengthy business processes, and much more.

                 <br><br>&emsp; Although happy with my my position at Farragut Systems, in 2017 I sought a new challenge. I desired to give back to the community and work as a High School Teacher, teaching students about one of my passions, History.
                 Teaching has been the single most challenging thing I have ever done! It is one thing to lead a lecture at a professional conference evert, but something totally different to
                 convince teenagers the value of education, and excitement that can be learned from History. However, I am not one to shy away from a challenge.
                 Countless hours spent late at night planning lessons, grading, and strategizing how to manage the classroom eventually paid off.
                 My students achieved fantastic results on state assessments, I was awarded with the "going green" award for 2 years in a row, was recognized as beginner teacher of the month twice, and
                 now act as the <b>Team Lead</b> of the American History department at my school.

                 <br><br>&emsp; Now, three years after beginning my career as a teacher, I am looking to transition back to the software industry.
                 Me and my wife brought our first child into the world, and with that change I have decided to focus my life on a passion that allows me
                 to spend more quality time with my family. Although teaching is a fantastic profession, it requires a huge amount of mental energy to excel.
                 I know that I could be a decent teacher, and still have the energy at the end of the day for my family, but I am not one that is ok
                 doing something "decent". I strive for excellence in my life.

                 <br><br>&emsp; I have spent the better part of a year teaching myself to program. I have used languages ranging from <b>C, C#, Visual Basic, JavaScript, Python, Flask, HTML, and CSS.</b>
                 So, although I am seeking a return to the software industry, it is with<b>new knowledge and experience coding in a variety of languages.</b>
                 I possess the skills to be a great educator, empathetic professional support, an experienced troubleshooter that works well under pressure, and now possess an understanding of
                 development languages and practices.

                 <br><br>&emsp; I hope to work with you all one day in the future, and if this website and my story appeal to you, let me know!
                 I love learning and sharing life experiences with new people!
